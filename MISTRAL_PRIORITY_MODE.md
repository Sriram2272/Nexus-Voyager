# 🧠 MISTRAL PRIORITY MODE - ENABLED

## ✅ Changes Applied - October 11, 2025

### 🎯 Goal: Prioritize Mistral 7B First!

**New Strategy:**
1. **ALWAYS ask Mistral 7B first** - It has extensive knowledge!
2. **Trust Mistral's answers** - Only go to web search if it truly doesn't know
3. **Faster responses** - Most questions answered from Mistral's vast dataset

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Improved `call_ollama_answer()` Function

**Enhanced Settings:**
```python
"timeout": 45,              # Increased from 30s for better answers
"temperature": 0.3,         # Balanced for quality
"num_predict": 800,         # Longer, detailed answers
"num_ctx": 4096            # Larger context window
```

**Smarter Detection:**
- Now ONLY goes to web search if Mistral explicitly says:
  - "I don't know"
  - "I cannot provide"
  - "I don't have access"
  - "I cannot browse"
  - etc.

**Better Trust:**
- Accepts answers as short as 30 characters (was 50)
- Trusts Mistral's knowledge base more
- Only rejects if truly uncertain

---

### 2. Enhanced Prompt

**Old Prompt:** Generic, cautious
**New Prompt:** 
```
You are Mistral 7B, a highly capable AI with extensive training data up to 2023.

- Use your training data confidently
- Provide detailed answers
- Only say "I don't know" if you truly have NO information
- Be confident in your existing knowledge!
```

This encourages Mistral to use its full knowledge base!

### 3. Updated Backend Logging

**Before:**
```
🧠 Checking Mistral with GPU...
```

**After:**
```
🧠 PRIORITY: Asking Mistral 7B first (GPU accelerated)...
   Mistral has extensive knowledge - will only use web if truly needed
```

More informative logging shows the priority strategy!
