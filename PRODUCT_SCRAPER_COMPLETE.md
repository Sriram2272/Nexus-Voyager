## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow

```
User enters query → Backend searches web → Gets search results →
Scrapes pages in batches of 5 → Extracts JSON data → 
Saves to files → Displays on frontend progressively
```

### Example Usage

**Input:**
```
Query: "top 20 laptops under 60000"
Limit: 20
Batch Size: 5
```

**Process:**
1. Search DuckDuckGo/Bing for laptops
2. Get 20 search results
3. Scrape 5 URLs at a time (4 batches total)
4. Extract structured JSON from each page
5. Display results progressively
6. Save each batch to JSON file

**Output:**
- 20 product cards with JSON data
- 4 batch files saved in `agent_state/`
- Each product has: title, URL, price, rating, images, metadata

---

## 📊 Data Structure Example

Each scraped product returns:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/laptop",
  "title": "Dell XPS 15 Laptop",

  "headings": {
    "h1": ["Dell XPS 15"],
    "h2": ["Specifications", "Features", "Reviews"],
    "h3": ["Display", "Processor", "Memory"]
  },
  "links": [
    {"text": "Buy Now", "href": "https://..."},
    {"text": "Compare", "href": "https://..."}
  ],
  "paragraphs": [
    "The Dell XPS 15 is a premium laptop...",
    "Features include 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD..."
  ],
  "json_ld": [
    {
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "Product",
      "name": "Dell XPS 15"
    }
