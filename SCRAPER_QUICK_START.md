## Troubleshooting

### Backend not running?
```powershell
cd "d:\Nexus AI"
python backend\app.py
```

### Port 5000 already in use?
- Close other applications using port 5000
- Or change the port in `backend\app.py` (line 155)

### No results found?
- Try a more specific search query
- Check your internet connection
- Try different search terms
