## 📦 Batch Processing

### How It Works

If you search for 20 laptops with batch size 5:

```
📦 Batch 1: Laptops 1-5   → Scrape → Save → Display
📦 Batch 2: Laptops 6-10  → Scrape → Save → Display
📦 Batch 3: Laptops 11-15 → Scrape → Save → Display
📦 Batch 4: Laptops 16-20 → Scrape → Save → Display
```

### Why Batches?

- ✅ **See results faster** - Don't wait for all 20
- ✅ **Better performance** - Easier on your browser
- ✅ **Rate limiting** - Be nice to websites
- ✅ **Error recovery** - One batch fails, others continue

---

## 💾 Where Data is Stored

All scraped data is saved in:
```
d:\Nexus AI\backend\agent_state\
```

Files look like:
```
scrape_batch_1_1704123456.json  ← Batch 1 (5 products)
scrape_batch_2_1704123467.json  ← Batch 2 (5 products)
scrape_batch_3_1704123478.json  ← Batch 3 (5 products)
scrape_batch_4_1704123489.json  ← Batch 4 (5 products)
```

Each file contains complete JSON data for that batch!
