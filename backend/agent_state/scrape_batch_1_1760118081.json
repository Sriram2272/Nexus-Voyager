But not every gaming laptop is built for the way in which you play. Maybe you're all about chasing those super-high frame rates in shooters. Or maybe you just want to get lost in story games with amazing graphics. Either way, performance matters.\n\nThat's where we come in.\n\nWe've tested every laptop on this list ourselves, and we didn't just look at the specs. We also paid attention to frame rates, thermals, keyboard feel, screen quality, and more. No fluff or filler here!\n\nWhy you should trust PCWorld for laptop reviews and buying advice\n\nIt’s in our name! PCWorld prides itself on laptop experience and expertise. We’ve been covering PCs since 1983, and we now review more than 70 laptops every year. All of the picks below have been personally tested and vetted by our experts, who’ve applied not only performance benchmarks but rigorous usability standards. We’re also committed to reviewing PC laptops at every price point to help you find a machine that matches your budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho should buy the Lenovo Legion 5i?\n\nIf you're after a gaming laptop that really delivers without wrecking your budget, this is the one. The Lenovo Legion 5i is fast, cool (literally!), and built to handle whatever you throw at it -- whether that's AAA titles, competitive shooters, or a little bit of everything. This is the laptop we'd recommend to most people because it gets all the important stuff right.\n\nThe Intel Core i9-14900HX packs a ton of power, and what’s cool is how quiet and chill it stays even when you’re really pushing it. The RTX 4060 does its job too, running games smooth on high settings, especially with DLSS turned on.\n\nThe 16-inch 165Hz screen is awesome -- nice and sharp, super responsive, and big enough for gaming or just getting stuff done. Plus, you get a full-sized keyboard with a number pad, RGB lighting you can mess with, and a 1080p webcam that even has a little switch to cover it up when you want privacy.\n\nAs a whole, this laptop really is the most well-rounded package.\n\nLenovo Legion 5i: Further considerations\n\nThe Legion 5i doesn't try to be the flashiest or lightest laptop on the block and that's okay. It focuses on what really matters -- power, cooling, and value -- and absolutely nails it.\n\nYou could spend more for an RTX 4070 setup, but unless you're pushing the most demanding titles at ultra settings, the RTX 4060 inside this machine will keep you more than happy. The battery life is pretty average, as expected from a gaming laptop, but most of us game plugged in anyway.\n\nWho should buy the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i 16 Gen 10?\n\nIf you want a no-compromises gaming machine, the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 is where it's at. It has an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX chip and RTX 5080 graphics, which is more than enough for buttery-smooth AAA gaming. The 16-inch OLED screen looks awesome, and that crazy fast 240Hz refresh rate makes everything feel super smooth when you’re gaming.\n\nLenovo Legion Pro 7i 16 Gen 10: Further considerations\n\nThe Legion Pro 7i is pricey and not exactly backpack-friendly at more than five pounds, but if you're chasing high frame rates and gorgeous visuals, this laptop delivers. Battery life isn't its strong suit, so plan to stay plugged in for long sessions. But when it comes to raw gaming power, this one's a beast.\n\nWho should buy the Acer Nitro V 16?\n\nThe Acer Nitro V 16 is a solid starter laptop if you’re watching your budget. It’s surprisingly good at running games, especially for the price. The AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU will give you plenty of power for smooth 1080p gaming. The 16-inch 1080p 165Hz screen is also big and runs nice and fast.\n\nBattery life isn't great, though. It clocked just around four hours in our tests, but that's to be expected -- it is a gaming laptop, after all. If you mostly game at your desk, then it's not a deal breaker.\n\nAcer Nitro V 16: Further considerations\n\nThis is a great pick for budget-conscious gamers who still want solid frame rates. You're getting a lot of power for the money.\n\nThe plastic build is one area where costs are trimmed. It doesn’t feel cheap, but you’ll notice the plastic around the touchpad and vents--it’s just not as fancy as metal. Still, it’s totally fine for everyday use and the peppy performance totally makes up for the plastic look.\n\nBottom line is, if you're okay skipping the fancy materials, the Nitro V 16 delivers where it counts -- gameplay.\n\nWho should buy the Razer Blade 14 (2025)?\n\nLooking for a gaming laptop that won’t kill your back? The Razer Blade 14 (2025) is only 3.59 pounds--that's crazy light for a beast like this. It's packing an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU and an RTX 5070 GPU, so it can easily handle modern games on High or Ultra settings. The 14-inch 2880x1800 120Hz OLED screen is a delight to behold and, somehow, it manages to stay cool and quiet even when it's under load. Oh, and that matte-black finish? Pretty slick.\n\nRazer Blade 14 (2025) : Further considerations\n\nIt’s not cheap or super flashy, but it hits the sweet spot for power and portability. Battery life is pretty good for a gaming laptop (just over 11 hours!), but don’t expect to game unplugged all day. The keyboard and touchpad are fine, speakers could be better. Still, if you want a capable gaming rig that you can carry with ease, this one’s worth it.\n\nWho should buy the Acer Chromebook 516 GE?\n\nIf you want to try out cloud gaming, the Acer Chromebook 516 GE is a solid pick. It can’t run games by itself (Chromebooks just aren’t built for that), but if you hook it up with GeForce Now or Amazon Luna, it actually runs pretty smooth.\n\nThe 16-inch 2560x1600 display is sharp and fast at 120Hz, and the Ethernet port is a must-have for a stable internet connection. It's also just a solid everyday Chromebook for work or school.\n\nAcer Chromebook 516 GE: Further considerations\n\nThis Chromebook was made for cloud gaming on the go. It's got enough power for daily tasks and the gameplay feel great (as long as your internet's up to the task). If you need offline play, you'll want a Windows laptop instead.\n\nOther gaming laptops we've tested\n\nWe've also tested a few other gaming laptops that impressed us, even if they didn't make the top cut. The Alienware m18 is a monster with its massive 18-inch 2560x1600 LCD display and high-end specs--great for immersion, not so great for your backpack or budget. Same goes for the MSI Raider 18 HX AI: powerful, but pricey. On the flip side, the Lenovo LOQ 15 is a solid budget pick. For around $799, you get reliable 1080p gaming thanks to the RTX 3050 graphics card. It's great for newcomers or anyone trying to save some cash.\n\nHow we test gaming laptops\n\nThe PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we’ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests.\n\nFor a much deeper look at our review methodology, check out&nbsp;how PCWorld tests laptops.\n\nWho curated this article?\n\nHi, I’m&nbsp;Ashley Biancuzzo, and I oversee all laptop and Chromebook coverage at PCWorld. While you’ll see me review Chromebooks on occasion, I’m also really into the broader world of consumer tech. I spend a lot of time writing and thinking about where laptops are headed–from AI and sustainable designs to long-term trends. When I’m not deep in the world of tech, you’ll probably find me gaming, getting lost in a good book, or chilling with my rescue greyhound, Allen.\n\nHow to choose the best gaming laptop\n\nTo find the best gaming laptop for your needs, pay close attention to the following features.\n\nWhat's the best screen for a gaming laptop?\n\nWhen you buy a gaming laptop, one of the most important decisions you’ll need to make regards the screen. After all, what you get on day one is what you’re stuck with until you junk the device. You could run an external monitor, but then, what’s the point of a laptop? Look for an IPS or OLED display, though&nbsp;gaming laptops under $1,000&nbsp;sometimes feature a TN panel. You can get buy with a 60Hz display if you mostly play single-player games, but thankfully, most gaming laptops these days opt for faster 120Hz+ panels instead.\n\nWhat's the best screen size for a gaming laptop?\n\nThe size of the screen dictates the size of the laptop itself, and thus weight. Think long and hard about whether you’re willing to take the weight penalty in exchange for the screen real estate.\n\nWhat's the best screen resolution for a gaming laptop?\n\nThe buzzword today is “4K.” That high resolution delivers sharper photo viewing and more space for video editing, but that doesn’t mean it’s for everyone. Anything not using the panel’s native resolution of 3840×2180, such as games running at lower-than-4K resolution, won’t look quite as sharp unless you exponentially increase the graphics power of the laptop.\n\nIf you’re running at 1920×1080 resolution because your GPU can’t hit 60fps at 4K, that feature is moot. For many gamers, 1920×1080 (1080p) or 2560×1440 (1440p) is more optimal.\n\nIPS vs. TN vs. OLED: What's the difference?\n\nThe panel technology is a key feature. IPS (in-plane switching) generally produces much greater color accuracy and superior off-axis viewing, but tends to lag in response times, which can lead to blurring. TN (twisted nematic) panels can offer far higher refresh rates and usually better response times than IPS, but can look washed out or just blah.\n\nA middle-ground technology that’s appearing more often is VA (vertical alignment). VA is sometimes alternately referred to as “wide viewing angle” technology. (Many assume this spec to be IPS, but it’s not). In our experience, we’ve found VA panels to run the gamut from being worthy competitors to IPS to being worse than the better TN panels.\n\nThe wildcard in all this is OLED. Unlike IPS, TN, and VA, OLED panels don’t rely on edge- or backlighting where “black” is produced by a shutter-like mechanism that blocks light from coming through. Instead, each pixel generates its own light. To produce black, it just switches off the light. This amounts to truly stunning contrast ratios and vibrant colors. OLEDs also boast fantastic response times.\n\nThe negatives include smaller screen sizes (we haven’t seen anything larger than 15.6 inches yet), higher cost, and lack of support for variable refresh rate.&nbsp;OLED panels can also use more power than conventional methods if the image is on a white background.\n\nShould a gaming laptop have G-Sync or FreeSync support?\n\nOkay, we called this section G-Sync and FreeSync, but the reality is, when it comes to beefy gaming laptops, it’s a GeForce GPU world. And that means it’s a G-Sync world. In a nutshell, Nvidia and AMD’s respective variable-refresh-rate technologies help synchronize the monitor and the GPU to greatly reduce screen tearing. Variable refresh rates can make gaming at 40fps far smoother to your eyes than a screen without it.\n\nThe first variable-refresh-rate panels for laptops maxed out at 75Hz, only marginally better than the standard 60Hz. More recently, we’ve begun to see laptop panels that can push 120Hz, 144Hz, and even 240Hz.&nbsp;This generally means smoother and sharper gaming to your eyes. It even helps smooth out everyday tasks such as scrolling a browser page or Word document.\n\nOne last very important note: G-Sync screens have to be connected directly to the laptop’s discrete GPU, which means a large hit on battery life. In most laptops without G-Sync, the Intel integrated graphics is connected directly to the screen, so the GPU can be turned off when not being used. So while G-Sync is beautiful to behold, the cost in battery life is huge.\n\nWhat should you look for in a gaming laptop keyboard and trackpad?\n\nA new trend in gaming laptops is the offset trackpad, which is more conducive to gaming than a dead-center trackpad. The concept is sound, but anyone who actually cares about PC gaming will just plug in a mouse. The worst thing about that offset trackpad is when you try to use it for non-gaming purposes.\n\nAs far as keyboards go, the most important gaming feature is n-key rollover. This means the keyboard physically scans each key separately. If you wanted to, you could press 20 keys simultaneously and they’d all register, as each is independently wired. That probably sounds excessive, but keyboards that lack this feature can suffer missed keystrokes, which both ruins gameplay and hurts in everyday tasks. \n\nOther keyboard considerations include LED backlighting (which adds ambiance but does nothing for gameplay) and mechanical keys vs. membrane. Mechanical keys are excellent--but are available on only a handful of laptops that usually weigh a ton. We have seen a few designs with low-profile mechanical keyboards, but even we admit they can be an acquired taste.\n\nWhat kind of storage is best for a gaming laptop?\n\nHaving your games load from an SSD instead of a hard drive significantly cuts down on load times. But beyond that, we haven’t found it to matter that much whether it’s a super-fast NVMe PCIe drive or a slower SATA SSD.\n\nWhat does matter more today is the size of the SSD rather than the interface it uses. With games now topping 50GB and some touching 100GBs, a once-spacious 256GB SSD will feel too small with just four games installed.\n\nSo when spec’ing out that gaming laptop, be mindful of just how much total storage you have. If you go for laptop with a small SSD and large hard drive combo, expect to install your games to the hard drive. If the laptop will have an SSD only, choose an absolute minimum of 512GB, with 1TB preferred.\n\nHow much RAM do you need in a gaming laptop?\n\nWhen laptop makers spec out gaming laptops, one of the levers they use to try to convince you to buy their product is upping the amount of RAM. It’s not hard to find gaming laptops with “upgraded” configurations that go from 16GB of RAM to 32GB.\n\nWhile having an adequate amount of RAM is important for gaming, today’s games typically top out at 16GB of RAM, and sometimes can run fine with just 8GB of RAM. Most people should invest in a gaming laptop with 16GB of memory if possible, and it makes sense to opt for 32GB if you plan on holding onto your gaming laptop for a long time. Modern games are only getting more memory-hungry.\n\nShould a gaming laptop have dual-channel or single-channel RAM?\n\nBesides the amount of memory, a couple of other important, but not critical, questions to ask is what clock speed and what mode. Modern CPUs let you run RAM in sets to increase the memory bandwidth.&nbsp;\n\nMore memory bandwidth immediately helps laptops that are running integrated graphics, but the conventional wisdom has long been that discrete GPUs in laptops don’t benefit as much because they have their own dedicated, much faster GDDR5 RAM to use. That’s typically the case, but the performance of today’s GPUs and CPUs can make this conventional wisdom wrong.&nbsp;\n\nGaming performance is often about a balance between the CPU and the GPU, and how graphically intensive a game is. With games that are graphically intensive, the GPU is the primary bottleneck on performance. Play a game that isn’t graphically intense, though, and the CPU can rapidly become the bottleneck on performance.\n\nWith the power of today’s GPUs, a lot of games, especially at a sedate resolution of 1920×1080, have shifted more performance to the CPU.&nbsp;The reason we’re talking about this now is if you rob the CPU of memory bandwidth, even a decently fast one, you can take a sizable hit in gaming performance.\n\nThe basic lesson is you should opt for dual-channel memory bandwidth configurations when possible. On a laptop spec sheet, you typically would see this expressed as “dual-channel” or “2 x 8” to indicate that two 8GB memory modules were used in a laptop.\n\nSome laptop makers will express memory in clock speed, so you’ll see “DDR4/2,133 or DDR4/2,400.” While a higher memory clock does increase memory bandwidth, the impact isn’t quite as great as going from dual-channel to single-channel mode.\n\nHow many CPU cores do you really need in a gaming laptop?\n\nFor most people on a budget, a 4-core CPU with Hyper-Threading will function just fine in most games, especially when combined with a lower-cost and lower performance GPU.\n\nStill, if you have the extra cash, a 6-core CPU with Hyper-Threading is likely the sweet spot for today and tomorrow. If you plan to stream your gaming live or edit it, investing in a 6-core is recommended.\n\nIntel and AMD’s top-end 8-plus-core CPUs will deliver the greatest benefit to those who might do other graphics-intensive tasks, such as 3D animation or video editing. If you also plan to record and stream video, the 8-core will offer a performance benefit there, too.\n\nIf you’re thinking, great, let me buy a 4-core Core i5 or Ryzen 5 CPU with a luxury laptop to save money, you usually can’t, because PC makers typically only offer budget CPUs with other budget parts. Why? Well, most budget shoppers can’t afford any luxury items, and most PC makers like to add in the extras to increase the profit.\n\nWhat GPU is best for a gaming laptop?\n\nThe single most important piece of hardware in a gaming laptop is undoubtedly the GPU. For AMD fans, the situation is as sad as it is in CPUs: It’s an Nvidia GeForce world.&nbsp;As with CPUs though, the good news is that the dominating products are top-notch.\n\nThe hardest part will be deciding just how much GPU you need. Our general guidance is to buy as fast a GPU as you can afford and are willing to heft. Generally, the faster the GPU (or GPUs), the larger and heavier the laptop. If you’re talking about playing on a higher-resolution panel of 2560×1440 at high-refresh rates, then keep increasing the amount of money spent on the GPU.\n\nWhat kind of battery life should a gaming laptop have?\n\nThe last topic we’ll cover is battery life. The best way to understand battery life on a gaming laptop is to accept that it’ll be horrible for all things gaming.\n\nThe minute you crank up a GPU on a gaming laptop to play a game, you’re basically limiting yourself to an hour or an hour and a half of battery runtime. Period. And in some cases, far less than that.\n\nThe only reason to consider battery life on a gaming laptop is if you want to use your laptop unplugged for non-gaming purposes. In that respect, you’ll find a lot of variance, with some offering decent battery life, albeit with a trade-off in gaming performance.\n\nWhat is the best gaming laptop?\n\nThe Lenovo Legion 5i is PCWorld's top gaming laptop. It delivers great performance and it stays relatively cool under load. It won't burn a hole in your wallet, either!\n\nWhat is the best cheap gaming laptop?\n\nThe Acer Nitro V 16 is PCWorld's best cheap gaming laptop. You get solid 1080p performance thanks to the RTX 4060 graphics, and the 165Hz display ensures smooth gameplay. \n\nWhen is the best time to buy a gaming laptop?\n\nThe best time to pick up a gaming laptop is during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or back-to-school season. Those deals will save you a lot of cash.\n\nShould you get a gaming laptop or a PC?\n\nIt really depends on your lifestyle. If you're someone that's always on-the-go, a gaming laptop is a good fit. But if you're okay with staying in one spot and want more power or upgrade options, a PC is a better choice.\n\nWhat's the difference between a gaming laptop and a regular laptop?\n\nA gaming laptop is made for handling games, so it has beefed-up graphics and better cooling. A regular laptop, on the other hand, is designed for everyday stuff like browsing or working on documents and operating unplugged for extended periods of time.\n\nRelated content",

              "reviewBody": "Who should buy the Lenovo Legion 5i?\n\nIf you're after a gaming laptop that really delivers without wrecking your budget, this is the one. The Lenovo Legion 5i is fast, cool (literally!), and built to handle whatever you throw at it -- whether that's AAA titles, competitive shooters, or a little bit of everything. This is the laptop we'd recommend to most people because it gets all the important stuff right.\n\nThe Intel Core i9-14900HX packs a ton of power, and what’s cool is how quiet and chill it stays even when you’re really pushing it. The RTX 4060 does its job too, running games smooth on high settings, especially with DLSS turned on.\n\nThe 16-inch 165Hz screen is awesome -- nice and sharp, super responsive, and big enough for gaming or just getting stuff done. Plus, you get a full-sized keyboard with a number pad, RGB lighting you can mess with, and a 1080p webcam that even has a little switch to cover it up when you want privacy.\n\nAs a whole, this laptop really is the most well-rounded package.\n\nLenovo Legion 5i: Further considerations\n\nThe Legion 5i doesn't try to be the flashiest or lightest laptop on the block and that's okay. It focuses on what really matters -- power, cooling, and value -- and absolutely nails it.\n\nYou could spend more for an RTX 4070 setup, but unless you're pushing the most demanding titles at ultra settings, the RTX 4060 inside this machine will keep you more than happy. The battery life is pretty average, as expected from a gaming laptop, but most of us game plugged in anyway.",

It’s surprisingly good at running games, especially for the price. The AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU will give you plenty of power for smooth 1080p gaming. The 16-inch 1080p 165Hz screen is also big and runs nice and fast.\n\nBattery life isn't great, though. It clocked just around four hours in our tests, but that's to be expected -- it is a gaming laptop, after all. If you mostly game at your desk, then it's not a deal breaker.\n\nAcer Nitro V 16: Further considerations\n\nThis is a great pick for budget-conscious gamers who still want solid frame rates. You're getting a lot of power for the money.\n\nThe plastic build is one area where costs are trimmed. It doesn’t feel cheap, but you’ll notice the plastic around the touchpad and vents--it’s just not as fancy as metal. Still, it’s totally fine for everyday use and the peppy performance totally makes up for the plastic look.\n\nBottom line is, if you're okay skipping the fancy materials, the Nitro V 16 delivers where it counts -- gameplay.",

It can’t run games by itself (Chromebooks just aren’t built for that), but if you hook it up with GeForce Now or Amazon Luna, it actually runs pretty smooth.\n\nThe 16-inch 2560x1600 display is sharp and fast at 120Hz, and the Ethernet port is a must-have for a stable internet connection. It's also just a solid everyday Chromebook for work or school.\n\nAcer Chromebook 516 GE: Further considerations\n\nThis Chromebook was made for cloud gaming on the go. It's got enough power for daily tasks and the gameplay feel great (as long as your internet's up to the task). If you need offline play, you'll want a Windows laptop instead.",

The 50-class cards might give you some extra oomph, but you're usually better off waiting for a 4060 to go on sale.</p><p>AMD's GPUs have significantly less market share in gaming laptops than Nvidia's chips.</p>"
