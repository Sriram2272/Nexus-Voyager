That's where the <a href=\"#section-the-best-budget-laptop-overall\">Acer Aspire Go 15</a> (for Windows 11) and <a href=\"#section-the-best-cheap-macbook\">MacBook Air M1</a> (for macOS) come in handy, as they offer decent performance, great battery life and great value for the money. </p><p><strong>Casual use: </strong>If you prefer to have a laptop for browsing websites, binge watching your favorite shows or jotting down a few notes, the good news is you won't have to pay a pretty penny for one. But you'll still want a decent display or even a touchscreen to interact with them far more easily. Chromebooks excel at this, and the <a href=\"#section-the-best-budget-chromebook\">Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-ideapad-slim-3x-review\">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3x</a> are fantastic options. The former is more premium (but great for watching shows), while the latter acts as a 2-in-1 that offers versatility. </p><p><strong>Gaming: </strong>If you don't want to break your bank account on a gaming laptop but still want enough power to run popular PC games, especially when it comes to multiplayer titles, getting a machine that offers a strong enough CPU and GPU, along with enough RAM, is essential. Budget laptops won't offer maxed-out graphics in AAA games, but they can still deliver excellent gameplay with smooth visuals. That includes the <a href=\"#section-the-best-budget-gaming-laptop\">MSI Cyborg 15</a> and <a href=\"#section-the-best-budget-gaming-laptop-alternative\">Acer Nitro V 15</a>, which boast RTX 40-series GPUs and surprisingly good performance &mdash; for the price, that is. </p>"

Although those numbers are a tad different for gaming laptops, as anything under $1,000/&pound;1,000 is what you can expect from a budget gaming machine. </p><p>Now, not all budget laptops are worth their low price. Some lean too hard on lackluster components to make up for their cheaper cost, but if it can barely open a Chrome tab or two without stuttering or, even worse, crashing, then there isn't much point in spending money on it. </p><p>Still, there are several laptops that offer a great price-to-performance ratio, and you can find some for around $300/&pound;300 while offering commendable power. If you're only looking for an entry-level machine to get everyday tasks done, then a budget laptop will help you save while also giving you the performance you require. </p>"
