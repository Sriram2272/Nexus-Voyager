# Web-Navigator-AI-Agent
We built a local AI agent that runs fully offline with Ollama models. It understands simple English commands, plans steps, drives the browser, and shows clean results. Extra features include meeting calls, transcripts, summaries, Ask-AI chat, and record/playback. All teamwork, no cloud needed.
