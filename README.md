# Web-Navigator-AI-Agent
We built a local AI agent that runs fully offline with Ollama models. It understands simple English commands, plans steps, drives the browser, and shows clean results. Extra features include meeting calls, transcripts, summaries, Ask-AI chat, and record/playback. All teamwork, no cloud needed.
NexusAI — Local AI Agent for Web Automation

This project was built for the hackathon challenge:
“Build an AI Agent that can take natural language instructions and autonomously drive the web on a local computer.”

We combined locally running LLMs (via Ollama) with browser automation to create an AI that can:

Understand user instructions in plain English,

Plan steps, drive the browser, and extract results,

Return structured outputs like tables or JSON,

Provide transcripts, summaries, and Ask-AI features after a session.

⚡ Important: The system runs 100% locally — all models are from Ollama (we experimented with many, from small fast ones to large reasoning models, including Gemma, LLaMA, Granite, Qwen, Smollm, Llava, BGE-m3, and others). No cloud APIs or keys are used.
